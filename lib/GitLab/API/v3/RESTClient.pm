=head1 NAME

GitLab::API::v3::RESTClient - GitLab API v3 REST client.

=head2 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the actual REST communication with the GitLab
server and is powered by L<Role::REST::Client>.

The various HTTP verb methods are wrapped so that they throw an
exception if an unexpected response is received, except for GET
requests that respond with a 404 code; these return C<undef>
instead.

If the request was successful then the response data is returned
rather than the response object itself.
